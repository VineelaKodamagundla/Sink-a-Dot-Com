# Sink-a-Dot-Com

## Sink a Dot Com game, with a ** 7x7 grid and three Dot Coms **.

##### Goal
> Sink all of the computer's Dot Coms in the fewest number of guesses.

##### Setup
> When the game is launched(run *DotComBust*), the computer places three Dot Coms(**each takes up three cells**), randomly, on the grid. When that's complete, the game asks for your first guess.

####How to play
> The computer will prompt you to enter a guess(*a cell*), which you'll type at the command line(as "a3","B4",etc).
  In response to your guess , you'll see a result at the command line as either "*hit*", "*kill*", "*miss*", or "*you sunk some.com*".
  When all three DotComs get sunk the game ends by printing your results.
